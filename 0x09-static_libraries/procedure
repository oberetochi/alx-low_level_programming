I copied all athe need task to the right directory using the cp command

I created a main.h file with the needed functions

I use the command (gcc -c *.c) to create the static library and when I run the command, it will create a (.o) file from all the c files (*.c selects all files that ends with the extension .c).

Then I use the (ar -rc libmy.a *.o) to create an archive (ar = archive, r = replace older files, c = create a new file if filename does not exist, libmy.a = filename and extension, *.o = selects all files with ending extension .o).

Then I use (ranlib libmy.a) to index it

Use ( ar -t filename and nm filename) to confirm both the archived and indexed files.

I use .gitignore to hide the *.o and *.c files
