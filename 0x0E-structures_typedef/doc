Defined a new type struct dog with the following elements:

- name, type = char *
- age, type = float
- owner, type = char *

That is my new dog structure, I saved it with dog.h as a header file, instead of #ifndef MAIN_H and #define MAIN_H; it will now be #ifndef DOG_H and #define DOG_H.

This struc tag\kes in 3 argument, name, age and owner
